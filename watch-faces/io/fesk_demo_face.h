/*
 * FESK DEMO FACE
 * 
 * A simple demonstration of the Harmonic Triad 3-FSK Acoustic Protocol (HT3).
 * 
 * This face demonstrates the fesk_tx protocol by transmitting the word "test"
 * when the alarm button is pressed. Features a countdown before transmission
 * similar to the chirpy demo.
 * 
 * Usage:
 * - ALARM button: Start transmission of "test"
 * - MODE button: Exit to next face
 * 
 * The transmission uses the HT3 protocol with 4:5:6 major triad frequencies
 * for pleasant, harmonious acoustic data transmission.
